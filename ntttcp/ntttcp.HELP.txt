NTttcp: [-s|-r|-l|-n|-p|-sp|-ns|-to|-a|-rb|-sb|-u|-w|-d|-t|-cd|-wu|-v|-6|-wa|-nic|-xml|-ndl] -m <mappings>

        -s   work as a sender
        -r   work as a receiver
        -l   <Length of buffer>         [default TCP: 64K, UDP: 128]
        -n   <Number of buffers>        [default: 20K]
        -p   <port base>                [default: 5001]
        -sp  Synchronize data ports, if used -p must be same on every instance.
        -ns  No sync. Senders will start sending as soon as possible.
             By default, senders will only start after they perform a handshake
             with receivers verifying readiness, using extra TCP connections.
             The option is helpful for many-session tests, reducing time for
             the test to start and increasing the max allowed connections.
             Either all or none of the NTttcp instances must have this option.
        -to  <timeout> in milliseconds. [default: 600000]
             I/O and thread waits will fail if hung for this duration.
             Set to 0 for infinite timeouts.  (NTttcp may hang indefinitely.)
        -a   <outstanding I/O>          [default: 2]
        -rb  <Receive buffer size>      [default: -1]
             If and only if non-negative, SO_RCVBUF will be set to this value.
             SO_RCVBUF of 0 will disable winsock receive buffering.
             If negative, use OS default behavior. (e.g. dynamic buffering)
        -sb  <Send buffer size>         [default: 0 with -a; 8K otherwise]
             If and only if non-negative, SO_SNDBUF will be set to this value.
             SO_SNDBUF of 0 will disable winsock send buffering.
             If negative, use OS default behavior. (e.g. dynamic buffering)
        -ndl set TCP_NODELAY socket option
        -u   UDP send/recv
        -w   WSARecv/WSASend
        -d   Verify Flag
        -t   <Runtime> in seconds. When with -n mans max test time and disables
             -wu and -cd flags.         [default (with -n): 3h]
        -cd  <Cool-down> in seconds
        -wu  <Warm-up> in seconds
        -v   enable verbose mode
        -6   enable IPv6 mode
        -wa  Sets the WAIT_ALL flag when using recv or WSARecv functions
        -nic <NIC IP>
             Use NIC with <NIC IP> for sending data (sender only).
        -xml [filename] save XML output to a file, by default saves to xml.txt
        -m   <mappings>
             Provide one or more mapping 3-tuples separated by spaces.
             mapping: session count, processor number, receiver address or name
             e.g. -m 4,0,1.2.3.4 sets up:
             4 sessions on processor 0 to test a network
