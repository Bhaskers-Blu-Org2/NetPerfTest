It is absolutely essential that variability be removed from any performance tests.  This is achieved by controlling for 
known variables in the system and fabric as best as possible.  This is a simple best practices list to aid in config.

Find matching pair of adapters and ports.
 - Check the MAC address to identify the actual port number.
 - Assume the lab wired Port0 to TOR0 and Port1 to TOR1 on all Hosts
 - Using the same port on both physical Hosts avoids TOR0 <-> TOR1 interlink noise and ensures single hop LAT

Check which NUMA node the NIC is under.
 - "Get-NetAdapterRss <NIC_NAME> | fl *", and check for the NUMA value
 - NumaNode                      : 0
 - "Get-NetAdapterRss <NIC_NAME> to view NUMA mapping.
 - "Set-NetAdapterRss <NIC_NAME> -MaxProcessorNumber 9
   - Or similar upper bound for the number of Cores on the associated NUMA node.
   - Note that Cross NUMA traffic is VERY noisy and can result ~50% TPUT difference.

Set system in high-performance mode:
- powercfg.exe /s 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c

Disable any C-State beyond C1
- powercfg -setacvalueindex scheme_current sub_processor IDLESTATEMAX 1
- powercfg -setactive scheme_current

If using VMs or Hyper-V Containers:
- For Minimum LAT, ensure the VM or Container is on the same NUMA node.
- For Maximum TPUT, ensure the VM or Container is on a separate NUMA node from the Phsical NIC
- For the absolute maximum performance of both TPUT and LAT, ensure the VM/Container are on the 
  same NODE as the Physical NIC, but only if the NUMA node has 20+ Cores.  This is a safe value 
  for 40G perf targets.
- To identify which NUMA node a VM is on, us:
  - Perfmon -> Hper-V VM VID Partition -> Preferred NUMA Node Index 
  - If not NUMA aligned, create a DUMMY VM profile nad start, then start the VM/Container to tests
    and inspect again if it landed on the desired NUMA node.
